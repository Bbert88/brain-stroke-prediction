# Predicting Brain Stroke using Machine Learning algorithms

## Topic

Using a machine learning algorithm to predict whether an individual is at high risk for a stroke, based on factors such as age, BMI, and occupation.

## Reason for topic

Strokes are a life threatening condition caused by blood clots in the brain, and the likelihood of these blood clots can increase based on an individual's overall health and lifestyle. Accurately predicting whether an individual may have a stroke could help save lives. We were also interested in seeing if there were any individual factors that are better at predicting strokes than others.
